# ERC721A: Gas Efficiency and Enumerable Implementation
## ERC721A

The [ERC721A implementation](https://www.erc721a.org/) was created by [Azuki](https://www.azuki.com/erc721a), and its main purpose is to allow for gas-efficient minting of multiple NFTs in one transaction. With this implementation, users will save on gas fees over the long run if they are minting more than one token at a time.

## How does ERC721A save gas?

It introduces a highly efficient method that doesn't burden the Ethereum network with unnecessary computational work. This streamlined approach significantly reduces gas fees and helps users avoid the common network congestion experienced when minting NFTs on Ethereum.

This method simplifies ownership checks, ensuring that users aren't overcharged for gas fees. By using ERC721A, creators can mint NFTs with confidence, knowing that they're saving both time and money, while also avoiding the frustration of network bottlenecks.

ERC721A saves gas by introducing an efficient way to check token ownership compared to traditional ERC-721 tokens. In standard ERC-721 tokens, determining ownership often involves a gas-intensive linear search through the owner's list of tokens. This can become costly, especially if the owner has numerous tokens.
Some features of ERC721A:
-   **Minimizing wasted storage space of token metadata (Removing duplicate storage from OZ ERC721Enumerable)**
-   **Updating the ownerâ€™s balance once per batch mint request, instead of per minted NFT**
-   **Updating the owner data once per batch mint request, instead of per minted NFT (Minimizing ownership state updates to once per batch minting)**

# ERC721A: Where Costs Are Added

ERC721A tokens introduce efficiencies in certain aspects but add costs in others. Let's explore where ERC721A adds costs:

## Token Transfer

One area where ERC721A adds costs is during token transfers. When a token is transferred from one address to another, ERC721A requires additional bookkeeping compared to simpler ERC-721 implementations.

# ERC721A Enumerable Implementation: Off-Chain Considerations

ERC721A, an extension of the ERC-721 standard, introduces an "enumerable" implementation that allows efficient listing of all tokens owned by a particular address. While this feature can be valuable for certain use cases, it is generally discouraged for on-chain use. Let's explore the reasons why ERC721A's enumerable implementation should be avoided on-chain:

## 1. Complexity

On-chain token enumeration introduces unnecessary complexity into smart contracts. Managing and updating lists of tokens for each address adds code complexity, making smart contracts harder to understand, test, and maintain. Complexity can increase the risk of introducing bugs or vulnerabilities into the contract.

## 2. Storage Costs

Storing lists of tokens for each address consumes additional storage space on the Ethereum blockchain. As the number of token holders and tokens in circulation grows, so does the storage cost. High storage costs can be prohibitive, especially in scenarios with a large number of tokens or token holders.

## 3. Gas Limit Concerns

The gas cost of on-chain operations is an important consideration. As the number of tokens or addresses increases, the gas cost associated with managing enumerable lists may approach or exceed Ethereum's gas limits. This can lead to transactions failing to execute, making the contract unusable in certain situations.

## 4. Security Risks

Implementing on-chain token enumeration can make smart contracts more susceptible to security risks. For example, malicious actors may manipulate the order of transactions (front-running) to exploit vulnerabilities introduced by the complex enumeration logic.

## Off-Chain Alternatives

In practice, it is often more practical to handle token enumeration and querying off-chain using specialized tools and services. Off-chain solutions can efficiently manage and query token lists without incurring on-chain complexity, storage, or gas costs. Developers can strike a balance between gas efficiency and contract simplicity by offloading token enumeration to off-chain applications.
IPFS does not rely on centralized servers or centralized storage systems and stores data on a distributed network. Therefore, IPFS can be considered as an alternative that enables data to be stored and shared off-chain.
In conclusion, while ERC721A's enumerable implementation offers advantages for certain use cases, it is generally not recommended for on-chain use due to complexity, storage costs, gas limits, and security concerns. Developers should carefully evaluate the trade-offs and consider off-chain alternatives for token enumeration.
