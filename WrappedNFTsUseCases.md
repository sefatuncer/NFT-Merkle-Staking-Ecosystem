## Wrapped NFTs  (Cross-chain NFTs)
The wrapped NFT pattern, also known as "wrapped NFTs" or "cross-chain NFTs," is a concept in the world of blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It involves representing NFTs from one blockchain or ecosystem on another blockchain by creating an equivalent or "wrapped" version of the original NFT. This allows NFTs to be used and traded across different blockchain networks or ecosystems.
Usage areas of wrapped NFTs are given in the following:

1.  **Cross-Platform Virtual Worlds:** Virtual worlds and metaverse projects can utilize wrapped NFTs to allow users to seamlessly move their virtual assets and avatars across different virtual platforms. This enhances the user experience and promotes interoperability.
    
2.  **Gaming Multiverse:** Wrapped NFTs can be used to create a multiverse gaming experience where in-game assets, characters, and items can exist and be traded across various blockchain-based games within the same universe.
    
3.  **NFT Lending and Borrowing:** Platforms can offer NFT lending and borrowing services, allowing users to use their wrapped NFTs as collateral to borrow other assets or stablecoins. This provides liquidity to NFT holders without selling their assets.
    
4.  **DeFi NFT Vaults:** DeFi protocols can create NFT vaults where users deposit wrapped NFTs as collateral to mint synthetic assets or earn yield through liquidity provision.
    
5.  **Cross-Chain Art Exhibitions:** Artists and art platforms can organize cross-chain art exhibitions, where artwork represented as wrapped NFTs can be displayed and sold on various blockchain-based art marketplaces.
    
6.  **Collectible Card Games:** In collectible card games (CCGs), players can use wrapped NFTs as virtual cards that can be traded and played across different blockchain-based CCG platforms.
    
7.  **Digital Identity and Reputation:** Wrapped NFTs can represent digital identity tokens that accumulate reputation and achievements from various blockchain-based projects or online communities.
    
8.  **Global Loyalty Programs:** Brands and businesses can create global loyalty programs using wrapped NFTs, rewarding customers with wrapped NFTs that can be redeemed or traded across different participating businesses.
    
9.  **Cross-Chain Crowdfunding:** Crowdfunding platforms can use wrapped NFTs to represent equity or ownership tokens, enabling investors to participate in projects on multiple blockchains.
    
10.  **Cross-Chain Charitable Initiatives:** Charities can issue wrapped NFTs to donors as tokens of appreciation or proof of contribution, which can then be used in various charitable projects across different blockchains.
    
11.  **Cross-Chain Virtual Real Estate:** Virtual real estate marketplaces can leverage wrapped NFTs to facilitate the buying and selling of virtual land or property across different virtual worlds or games.
    
12.  **Music and Entertainment NFTs:** Musicians and content creators can use wrapped NFTs to distribute and monetize their digital content, allowing fans to access and support their work across different blockchain ecosystems.
    
These special applications demonstrate how wrapped NFTs can enhance and expand the possibilities for various industries and use cases, creating more interconnected and versatile blockchain ecosystems.
